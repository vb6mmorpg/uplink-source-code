      <p align="center"><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="+1"><b>Language</b></font></p>
      <p align="left">&nbsp;</p>
      <p align="left"><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="-1">This 
        is a small but really rather clever perl script (written by John Knottenbelt 
        - our Linux guru) to allow us to translate Uplink into any language we 
        chose. It's still quite an involved process, since Uplink was never designed 
        with this in mind. Using this script will make life a lot easier for you.</font></p>
      <p align="left"><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="-1">It's 
        worth pointing you at paragraph 2.4 in the license agreement, which states</font></p>
      <p align="left"><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="-1"><i>&quot;Without 
        the express written permission of Introversion, you will not distribute 
        in any format any non-English version of Uplink.&quot;</i></font></p>
      <p align="left"><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="-1">What 
        this means is that if you translated the game into (say) French, you wouldn't 
        be able to distribute it without our written permission. We want you to 
        go ahead and translate into other languages though - so please go ahead 
        - just keep in mind you can't distribute them yourself. If you do manage 
        to finish a language translation that you think Introversion would be 
        interested in (pretty much any language other than English/Russian/German) 
        then get in contact with us and we'll work out a deal. If you've done 
        the translation work then we'll be happy to cut you in on the profits.</font></p>
      <p align="left">&nbsp;</p>
      <p align="left"><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="-1">The 
        basic process behind the script is this.</font></p>
      <blockquote> 
        <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="-1">1. Put the translate.pl 
          script into the source directory</font></p>
        <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="-1">2. Run the script 
          once to extract all the in-game strings to a file called strings.txt</font></p>
        <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="-1">3. Provide translations 
          of all the strings in that file that need translating (eg not debug 
          messages)</font></p>
        <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="-1">4. Run the script 
          again to re-integrate the translated strings into the source code</font></p>
        <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="-1">5. Re-compile Uplink 
          with the translations in place.</font></p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
      </blockquote>
      <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="-1">We've already provided 
        a strings.txt file with every in-game string from version 1.31 of Uplink 
        (the very latest). We recommend you start with this, as many strings are 
        already marked as debug messages which don't need translating. Move the 
        strings.txt file into your source directory next to translate.pl to use 
        the existing strings. </font></p>
      <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="-1">In strings.txt you 
        will see entries like this:</font></p>
      <p><font size="-1" face="Courier New, Courier, mono"><b>en*: "Finished saving 
        %s\n" </b></font></p>
      <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="-1">The 'en*' at the 
        front indicates it's in English, and the '*' indicates it _doesn't_ need 
        translating because it's a debug message. You'll also see entries like 
        this:</font></p>
      <p><font face="Courier New, Courier, mono" size="-1"><b>en: &quot;Multiple 
        Uplink Agent murders reported&quot;<br>
        gr: &quot;Mehrere Morde an Uplink Agenten gemeldet&quot;</b></font></p>
      <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="-1">The first line starts 
        with 'en' which indicates it's an English string that needs translation. 
        The next line is a German translation of that line. We've left the German 
        strings in the file as an example. You can actually have as many different 
        translations in the strings.txt file as you wish, so long as each starts 
        with a different 2 letter country code, such as 'en' or 'gr' or 'ru'. 
        Each translation &quot;block&quot; consists of an English string, followed 
        by any number of other-language translations, followed by a blank line.</font></p>
      <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="-1">Whenever you add 
        new strings to the game, or change existing ones, you can re-extract the 
        strings using the command</font></p>
      <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="-1"><i><font face="Courier New, Courier, mono"><b>perl 
        translate.pl --prune</b></font></i></font></p>
      <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="-1">This will go through 
        all the source files recursively and will add in any new strings needed, 
        and remove any unused ones. It will put all the strings into a new file 
        called strings-pruned.txt. The original strings.txt is unmodified.</font></p>
      <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="-1">If you want to generate 
        an entirely new strings.txt file, you should first create an empty strings.txt 
        file. Then run the command &quot;perl translate.pl --prune&quot;. This 
        will put all the strings into the new file strings-pruned.txt. Keep in 
        mind that you will have lost all of the 'en*' signs that signify a string 
        doesn't need translating.</font></p>
      <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="-1">Once you've translated 
        all the strings marked as 'en' (there are many thousands unfortunately) 
        you can re-integrate them like this:</font></p>
      <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="-1"><i><font face="Courier New, Courier, mono"><b>perl 
        translate.pl --lang=gr</b></font></i></font></p>
      <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="-1">This will take all 
        the translations that start with 'gr' (insert your own country code here) 
        and put them into the source files. The translated files will have the 
        same filename, but with -trans on the end. For example uplink.cpp will 
        be translated to uplink-trans.cpp. You can then build those trans files 
        to get the new language.</font></p>
