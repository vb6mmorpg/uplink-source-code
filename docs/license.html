        <p align="left"><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="-1">PREAMBLE<br>
          At Introversion Software we believe that a game should not die simply 
          because it has reached the end of it's corporate development cycle. 
          That said, a open-source unlimited distribution of the game is not practical 
          for two reasons:<br>
          1. It would be in breach of the licensing agreements that we have with 
          third party publishers<br>
          2. Due to the &quot;hand-to-mouth&quot; nature of Independent Games 
          publishing a nominal fee for the source code of previous projects can 
          go a long way to ensure the funding of future development projects </font></p>
        <p align="left"><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="-1">By 
          releasing the source code we hope that Uplink will be modified in a 
          variety of different ways:<br>
          &middot; With additional functionality<br>
          &middot; To Different Platforms<br>
          &middot; To Different Languages</font></p>
        <p align="left"><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="-1">We 
          envisage that Additional functionality will be achieved through the 
          medium of patches and we do not need to regulate this. That said, we 
          must insist that the user has a bone-fide version of Uplink installed 
          and as a consequence stand-alone binaries will be in breach of this 
          agreement. </font></p>
        <p align="left"><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="-1">Different 
          platforms and languages are slightly different. If we were to allow 
          a port to a different platform or language, this would potentially exclude 
          us from entering this market. In addition it may put us in violation 
          of any agreements between us and third party developers whom we had 
          paid to generate the new versions. That said if a port is produced for 
          a platform or language that we had not considered or were not currently 
          involved with, then we would be happy to consider licensing the version 
          from the developer for an agreed royalty.</font></p>
        <p align="left"><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="-1">The 
          fundamentals are simple. If you change uplink and produce a &quot;patch&quot; 
          for a platform that we have sold on, then feel free to distribute it. 
          If you produce a totally new version, contact us and we'll try to work 
          something out.</font></p>

          TERMS AND CONDITIONS FOR COPYING, DISTRIBUTION AND MODIFICATION OF THE 
          UPLINK SOURCE CODE</font></p>
        <p align="left"><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="-1">1.1 
          This License applies to the computer software known as &quot;Uplink&quot;, 
          developed and marketed by Introversion Software Ltd of Winchester House, 
          36 Winchester Road, Walton-On-Thames, Surry, KT12 2RH, UK (herein referred 
          to as &quot;Introversion&quot; or &quot;Us&quot; or &quot;we&quot; or 
          &quot;our&quot;). The &quot;Program&quot;, below, refers to the Uplink 
          executable, and a &quot;work based on the Program&quot; means either 
          the Program or any derivative work under copyright law: that is to say, 
          a work containing the Program or a portion of it, either verbatim or 
          with modifications and/or translated into another language. (Hereinafter, 
          translation is included without limitation in the term &quot;modification&quot;.) 
          Each licensee is addressed as &quot;you&quot;.</font></p>
        <p align="left"><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="-1">1.2 
          Activities other than copying, distribution and modification are not 
          covered by this License; they are outside its scope. The act of running 
          the Program is not restricted.</font></p>
        <p align="left"><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="-1">1.3 
          You may not copy or distribute verbatim copies of the Program's source 
          code as you receive it. However, if you make serious modification to 
          the functionality of the program, then you may distribute only such 
          files as are necessary to share your modifications.</font></p>
        <p align="left"><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="-1"><br>
          2. You may modify your copy or copies of the Program or any portion 
          of it, thus forming a work based on the Program, and copy and distribute 
          such modifications or work under the terms of Section 1 above, provided 
          that you also meet all of these conditions:</font></p>
        <p align="left"><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="-1">2.1) 
          You must cause the modified files to execute only if a copy of Uplink 
          purchased from Introversion Software (or one of it's licensed distributors), 
          is also installed on the machine. The modified version can require any 
          version of Uplink to be installed, however you must state this in a 
          read-me file attached with the distribution. You may only distribute 
          the files in object or executable form, you may not distribute the source 
          files unless in complete accordance with this license (Para 2).</font></p>
        <p align="left"><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="-1">2.2) 
          You must not release a &quot;stand-alone&quot; binary. By this we mean 
          a version of the Program that will execute without an enforced dependency 
          on installation of a version of Uplink purchased from Introversion or 
          one of its licensed distributors.</font></p>
        <p align="left"><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="-1">2.3) 
          Without the express written permission of Introversion, you will not 
          distribute, in any format any version of the program targeted on &quot;PocketPC&quot;, 
          &quot;PalmOS&quot;, any other PDA Operating System, &quot;GameCube&quot;, 
          &quot;Gameboy&quot; (including &quot;Gameboy Advanced&quot;), &quot;Microsoft 
          X-box&quot;, &quot;Sony Playstation&quot;, any other game console, Macintosh 
          or any other platforms other than Microsoft Windows (for the PC) or 
          Linux.</font></p>
        <p align="left"><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="-1"><br>
          2.4) Without the express written permission of Introversion, you will 
          not distribute in any format any non-English version of Uplink.</font></p>
        <p align="left"><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="-1">3. 
          You may not copy, modify, sublicense, or distribute the Program except 
          as expressly provided under this License. Any attempt otherwise to copy, 
          modify, sublicense or distribute the Program is void, and will automatically 
          terminate your rights under this License.<br>
          <br>
          4. You are not required to accept this License, since you have not signed 
          it. However, nothing else grants you permission to modify or distribute 
          the Program or its derivative works. These actions are prohibited by 
          law if you do not accept this License. Therefore, by modifying or distributing 
          the Program (or any work based on the Program), you indicate your acceptance 
          of this License to do so, and all its terms and conditions for copying, 
          distributing or modifying the Program or works based on it.</font></p>
        <p align="left"><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="-1">5. 
          Each time you redistribute the Program (or any work based on the Program), 
          the recipient automatically receives a license from the original licensor 
          to copy, distribute or modify the Program subject to<br>
          these terms and conditions. You may not impose any further restrictions 
          on the recipients' exercise of the rights granted herein. You are not 
          responsible for enforcing compliance by third parties to this License.</font></p>
        <p align="left"><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="-1">6. 
          If, as a consequence of a court judgement or allegation of patent infringement 
          or for any other reason (not limited to patent issues),conditions are 
          imposed on you (whether by court order, agreement or otherwise) that 
          contradict the conditions of this License, they do not excuse you from 
          the conditions of this License. If you cannot distribute so as to satisfy 
          simultaneously your obligations under this License and any other pertinent 
          obligations, then as a consequence you may not distribute the Program 
          at all.</font></p>
        <p align="left"><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="-1">7. 
          If any portion of this section is held invalid or unenforceable under 
          any particular circumstance, the balance of the section is intended 
          to apply and the section as a whole is intended to apply in other circumstances.</font></p>
        <p align="left"><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="-1">8. 
          This license is governed by UK Law.</font></p>
