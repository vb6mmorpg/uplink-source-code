          access, you need to send an email to <a href="mailto:devcd@introversion.co.uk">devcd@introversion.co.uk</a>. 
          In that email you need to tell us your Forum username, the email you used on the <a href="http://store.introversion.co.uk/">store</a> and the order number.
          You need to have already registered your username as 
          a standard forum user of course.
		  You will have received your order number when you placed your online order for the Developer CD.
		  We need your <a href="http://store.introversion.co.uk/">store</a> 
          account email and your order number to make sure you did actually order the CD from us ;)</font></p>
        <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="-1">We will then give
